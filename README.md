# MetflixNextJS14

MetflixNextJS14 is a project developed with the aim of practicing the latest features of Next.js 14.2, focusing on data fetching and other modern capabilities of the framework.

## Motivation
The primary motivation behind this project is to explore and utilize the new features of Next.js 14.2, especially the enhanced data fetching methods. By integrating the Kinopoisk API, the project demonstrates how to effectively manage and display movie data within a Next.js application.

## Overview
This project leverages Next.js 14.2's latest functionalities, including:

- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-rendering pages at build time, allowing for efficient caching and quick page loads.
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**: Updating static content without needing a full rebuild, ensuring content freshness.

I implement clever search for navbar search when you aren't /films route and basic query search when you are in /films route. And for data fetching im use Kinopoisk API Integration.
